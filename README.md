# labspt2-league-management

## Project Overview

The sports community is currently fragmented where each sport has its own sports apps.  League Management allows users to run all of their sports leagues from one hub minimizing the amount of time and effort required.  User Admins can create a sports league, add teams, and manage their season schedule. Coaches can access their dashboard to request cancellations of games if an unforeseen incident occurs.
